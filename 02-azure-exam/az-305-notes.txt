Scale out:    <-- it means add more instances as per the condition applied
Scale in:     <-- it means delete instances as per the condition applied


SKU:  Stock keeping Unit

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NSG (Network security Group):  
------------------------------
-) when a default NGS we apply to a Subnet/Virtual-Machine then by-default
   all  inbound/outbound port/protocol are open at Rule-Priority=65000 & 65001

-) You can assign NSG to the Subnet of the VNet in the same region where NSG is. 
   If NSG1 is in East US and only VNet3 Subnets are in East US.


Virtual Network - Subnet
-----------------------
Both "Virtual Network" and "Subnet", NSG, Network-Interface should be in a same region.

The VNet Integration feature has two variations
---------------------------------------------
-) Regional virtual network integration: When you connect to virtual networks in the same region, 
    you must have a dedicated subnet in the virtual network you're integrating with.

-) Gateway-required virtual network integration: When you connect directly to virtual networks in 
   other regions or to a classic virtual network in the same region, you need an 
   Azure Virtual Network gateway created in the target virtual network.

Note: If the VNet is in the same region, either create a new subnet or select an empty preexisting subnet.  <-- not understand



VM (Virtual Machine):  
---------------------
when a default rule is applied it means "deny" everything port is blocked, means every port & protocol is blocked



NIC (Network interface card)
----------------------------
You can move a NIC to a different RG or Subscription by selecting (change) next to the RG or Subscription name.
If you move the NIC to a new Subscription, you must move all resources related to the NIC with it. 
If the network interface is attached to a virtual machine, for example, you must also move the virtual machine, 
and other virtual machine-related resources.

e.g: 
RG-1= West US
RG-2= East US
NIC= West US

Note: assume NIC is in RG-1, if we move it to RG-2, that we can do but NIC will still remain in "WEST US" 

-) A public and a private IP address can be assigned to a single network interface. By default a NIC is associated 
to one IP address. Anyway nothing prevents a NIC to have MORE THAN ONE IP address. So to the VM's NIC, you can 
associate the public and the private IP at the same time. You are not forced to have one NIC for the 
public IP and one NIC for the private IP.

Note: we can define "Rule-priority" in a Network-interface  ranges inbetween  100  till  4096 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Azure AD roles
--------------
The Azure AD roles include four roles:

1) Global administrator   – The highest level of access, including the ability to grant administrator access 
                            to other users and to reset other administrator’s passwords, can create and manage users.
                            He can  add/modify  new "Security Questions/Security" options to a user account.                               
2) User administrator     – Can create and manage users and groups, and can reset passwords for users, 
                            Helpdesk administrators and User administrators.
                            He can not add/modify  new "Security Questions"/Security options to a user account.
                            Users with this role can create users, and manage all aspects of users with some restrictions, 
                            and can update password expiration policies. Additionally, users with this role can create and 
                            manage all groups. This role also includes the ability to create and manage user views, 
                            manage support tickets, and monitor service health. User Administrators don't have permission to 
                            manage some user properties for users in most administrator roles. Admins with this role do not 
                            have permissions to manage MFA or manage shared mailboxes.

3) Helpdesk administrator – can change the password for users who don’t have an administrator role and 
                              they can invalidate refresh tokens, which forces users to sign back in again.
4) Billing Administrator  – can make purchases and manage subscriptions.


Note:
Create "New-Users" <-- only "Global Administrator" who created that tanent in the AD, means user1 create "abc.cloudconnect.onmicrosoft.com"
                       so "User1" is "Global Administrator" for this tanent, so he can create new users under it
                    "User Administrator"  can also create new users but first we have to assing this role for the
                     tanent "abc.cloudconnect.onmicrosoft.com" to "User Administrator" then he can do it. By-default he can not create user
                     under every tanent

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Azure roles (RBAC)
-----------
The four fundamental roles are:

1) Owner                     – Full rights to change the resource and to change the access control to grant permissions to other users.
                               The "Owner Role" lets you manage everthing, including access to resources and creation of resources.
                               It can deploy VM and manage "Virtual-Networks"

2) Contributor               – Full rights to change the resource, but not able to change the access control.
                               "change" means here create, update, delete, start, restart and power off.
                               It can deploy VM and manage "Virtual-Networks"                               
                             - This role does not allow you to assign roles in Azure RBAC, manage assignments in Azure Blueprints, 
                               or share image galleries.
                             - Contributors have permissions to contribute fully to the project code base and work item tracking. 
                               The main permissions they don't have or those that manage or administer resources.

3) Network Contributer       - This role lets you manage networks, including creating subnets.
                              -) When we want to give a "User" priveleges to add a backend-pool of VM  or add Heealth-route to a  "Load-Balancer"
                              then we have to attach this role to the "Resourse-Group", we can not assign this role directly to "Load-Balancer" 
                              because we need IP of VMs to add in Backend-pool

4) Security Admin            - With this role we can view security policies, view security states, edit security policies, 
                               view alerts and recommendations, dismiss alerts and recommendations.

5) Reader                     – Read-only access to the resource

6) User Access Administrator  – No access to the resource except the ability to change the access control.
                                if a User already has "Reader-role" then plus with this role a "User" can assign the "Reader-role" to other users also.

7) Cloud Device Administrator - Users in this role can enable, disable and delete devices in Azure AD and read Windows 10 
                                BitLocker keys(if present) in the Azure portal. This role does not frant permissions to manage
                                any other properties on the device.

Virtual MAchine Contributor   - Lets you manage virtual machines, but not access to them, and not the virtual network or storage account 
                                they're connected to.                               
          
Virtual MAchine Administrator Login - View Virtual Machines in the portal and login as administrator.

-----------------------------
Storage Blob Data Reader 
or 
Storage Blob Data Contributor
and 
Azure Resource Manager Reader role       <-- a "Global administrator" needs these roles to read a blob in a Storage-Account 
----------------------------------------------------------

Azure AD Roles                                         Azure Roles(RBAC)
----------------                                       ------------
These are used to "control access of AD resources  |   They are used to "control access" to Azure resources
                                                   |
AD resources are:                                  |    Azure resources are:
Users, Groups, Billing, Licensing,                 |    Virutal Machines, Databases, Cloud Storage, Cloud Networking  etc...
Application Registration ...etc                    |                                   
---------------------------------------

Note: 
By default, the "Global Administrator" does not have access to Azure resources.
"Global Administrator" can gain access to azure resource if granted the "User Access Administrator role(an Azure role)"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Logic App (Roles)
-----------------

DevTest Labs User role 
----------------------
it only lets you connect, start, restart, and shutdown virtual machines in your Azure DevTest Labs.


Logic App Contributor role 
-------------------------
it lets you manage logic app, but not access to them. It provides access to view, create, edit, and update a logic app.
Grants full access to manage all resources, but does not allow you to assign roles in Azure RBAC, 
manage assignments in Azure Blueprints, or share image galleries.



Logic App Operator role 
-----------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LRS	(Local redundant storage):  <-- Stores data synchronously three times at one physical location.

ZRS	(Zone redundant storage):   <-- Stores data synchronously three times at three physical locations in the same region.
                                    Durability 99.999999999%

GRS	(Geo redundant storage):    <--GRS copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the 
                                      primary region using LRS. It then copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location 
                                  in the secondary region. Within the secondary region, your data is copied synchronously three times using LRS 
                         "GRS" --  Only allows to be read in the secondary zone in the even of a failover from the primary to secondary                       
                      "RA GRS" --  "RA" means "Read-Access", Cross-regional replication with read access to the replica. RA-GRS provides read-only  
                                    access to the data in the secondary location, in addition to geo-replication across two regions,
                                    It is more expensive compared to GRS. Because in the "GRS" we can Read data from Secondary-Region only in the
                                    case of "Failover" of the Primary-region, here in "RA GRS" we can directly read the data from Secondary-Region
                                    without the "Failover" of the Primary-region



GZRS (Geo-zone-redundant storage):   <-- Combination of GRS and ZRS. Stores data synchronously three times in 
                                       three physical locations (zones) in the primary region (ZRS) and additionally 
                                       asynchronously three times in a single zone in a secondary physical region (GRS).

Prices:
-------
 GRS      <-- here we will pay for "Primary" and "Secondery" region
              we will pay data-transfer from "Primary" to "Secondery" region
              we will pay pay for data-transfer from one availability-zone to another availability-zone


========================================================================================================
Azure Storage
------------

SAS     <-- Shared access signature

Note: every "Storage-Account" has these 3 types, either it is a LRS, ZRS or GRS 

Their are 3 types of "Tier"
Imp: These below three tier types are only supported by "General Purpose v2"  and "Blob Storage"

a) Hot tier  
-----------
An online tier optimized for storing data that is accessed or modified frequently. 
The hot tier has the highest storage costs, but the lowest access costs.

b) Cool tier
------------
An online tier optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed or modified. 
Data in the cool tier should be stored for a minimum of 30 days. 
The cool tier has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the hot tier.

c) Archive tier
---------------
An offline tier optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed, 
and that has flexible latency requirements, on the order of hours. 
Data in the archive tier should be stored for a minimum of 180 days.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Object Replication (Copy data from  "Storage-account-1"  to "Storage-account-2" )
------------------

-) Object replication is supported for general-purpose v2 storage accounts, and for premium block blob accounts in preview. 
   Both the source and destination accounts must be either general-purpose v2 or premium block blob accounts.
   Object replication supports block blobs only; append blobs and page blobs are not supported.
-) Blob versioning should be enabled on both the source and destination storage account.
-) Change feed should be enabled on the source account



Azure Import/Export service supports:
Import:   <-- Import supports "Azure Blob storage" and "Azure File storage"
Export:   <-- Export supports only "Azure Blob storage"

Extra point:  Blob can not be backup with the "Azure Vault service"
Extra point:  "AzCopy" command can copy data only for "Blobs" and "Files"

==========================================================================================================
Route table
-----------

Next hop type: 
Virtual appliance     <-- it means a "Virtual Machine"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Virtual Machine scale set  (old was "Availability sets"  but new is "Virtual Machine scale sets")
-------------------------

Orchestration modes
-------------------

Virtual machine scale sets will support 2 distinct orchestration modes:

1) ScaleSetVM "Virtual machine instances added to the scale set are based on the scale set configuration model. 
The virtual machine instance lifecycle – creation, update, deletion – is managed by the scale set.

2) VM (virtual machines)" Virtual machines created outside of the scale set can be explicitly added to the scaleset.

Imp:
-) When you create a VM, you can optionally specify that it is added to a virtual machine scale set. A VM can only be 
   added to a scale set at time of VM creation. The newly created VM must be in the same resource group as 
   the Flexible scale set regardless of deployment methods.
-) You can add the virtual machine to a scale set in the same region, zone, and resource group.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DNS (Domain name service)
-------------------------

DNS Port is "53"  <-- on the port basis AWS put the service name "Route 53" of its DNS service

A virtual network can be linked to private DNS zone as a registration or as a resolution virtual network.

Registration virtual network: 
------------------------------
A private DNS zone can have multiple registration virtual networks. However,every virtual network can 
only have one registration zone associated with it. 
it means that (One DNS-zone have one Virtual network, because it is autoassing is YES "Enable Auto Registration")

Resolution virtual network: 
---------------------------
One private DNS zone can have multiple resolution virtual networks and a virtual network 
can have multiple resolution zones associated to it.
it means that (ONE DNS-zone can have multiple Virtual-network and one Virtual-network can assign to multiple DNS-zone
because we mapping mannully so we can map many DBS-zone with one Virtual-network, in this case auto-assing is NO "Enable Auto Registration")

(Imp)
Q) How to connect to a domain named "www.abc.com" to a webapp ?
-) You can use either a CNAME record or an A record to map a custom DNS name to App Service.
-) You should use CNAME records for all custom DNS names except root domains (for example, abc.com). For root domains, use A records.

Imp:
----
When we link a  "Virtual-Network" with a "Private DNS Zone" then a DNS record gets created automatically for each VM deployed in 
that "Virtual-Network"




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
App service
-----------

Scale up          <-- it means we are adding more resources in a single app, means more ram,cpu 
                     we can say it is a Vertical scaling
Scale out         <-- it means we are adding more instances, it is like a Horizontal scaling
                    
Scale in:     <-- it means delete instances as per the condition applied


Note: 
App-service  resources are region-specific and can not be moved across regions.
You must create a copy of your existing App Service resources in the target region, 
then move your content over to the new app. You can then delete the source app and App Service plan.
To make copying your app easier, you can clone an individual App Service app into an App Service plan in another region.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lock
----

Delete (or we can say "CanNotDelete lock")
------
-) A resource with delete lock, can be moved to another RG, because the resource by itself is not deleted and keeps on existing despite the move.
-) A cannot-delete lock on a resource group prevents Azure Resource Manager from automatically deleting deployments in the history.
If you reach 800 deployments in the history, your deployments fail.
-) delete lock that means you cant delete but you can definitely move new resources in it.


Read-Only
---------
-) ReadOnly means authorized users can read a resource, but they cannot delete or update the resource.
-) A resource with readonly lock, can be moved to another RG, because the resource attributes do not change with the move.
it means authorized users can read a resource, but they can not delete or update it, applying this lock is similar to restricting a authorized
users to the permissions that the "Reader" role privides.
-) A read-only lock on a resource group that contains an App Service plan prevents you from scaling up or out the plan.

-) A read-only lock on a resource group that contains a virtual machine prevents all users from starting or restarting a virtual machine.
   These operations require a POST method request.

Note(imp) (below means that we put a lock on "Resource group")
---------
But if the resource is a RG and it has a readonly lock, its child resources can’t be moved to another RG, 
because the RG attributes (in this case, the child resources’ list) would try to be modified, hence, prevented by the lock.
If the RG has a delete lock, its child resources can be moved to another RG.


Imp:
----
ASP.NET   WebApp can be created/hosted only on Windows
".NET Core 3.0"  or  "ASP.NET core"    WebApp can be created/hosted only on both  Windows/Linux OS




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tags
----
Tags applied to the resource group are not inherited by the resources in that resource group.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Load Balancer (LB)
------------------

-) You can only attach virtual machines that are in the same location and on the same virtual network as the LB. 
  Virtual machines must have a standard SKU public IP or no public IP.
-) The LB needs to be a standard SKU to accept individual VMs outside an availability set or vmss. 
  VMs do not need to have public IPs but if they do have them they have to be standard SKU. 
  Virtual machines can only be from a single network. When they don’t have a public IP they are assigned an ephemeral IP.

Note: when adding them to a backend pool, it doesn’t matter if the VM is running or stop



Basic Load Balancer: 
-------------------
Basic Load-Balancer supports  Virtual machines in a "single availability set" or "virtual machine scale set".


Standard Load Balancer:
-----------------------
Standard Load-Balancer supports any "virtual machines" or "virtual machine scale sets" in a "single virtual network".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CNI  (Azure Container Networking Interface)
---
With Azure CNI, every pod gets an IP address from the subnet and can be accessed directly. 
These IP addresses must be unique across your network space.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DNS ( Domain name service)
----

FQDNS  <-- Fully qualified Domain name service

if we do "nslookup" on any ip of the "VM" then it return us always "[VM-name].internal.cloudapp.net" 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Network Watcher  (below are the services comes under "Network watcher")
--------------

Packet capture:
-) Network Watcher variable packet capture allows you to create packet capture sessions to track traffic 
   to and from a virtual machine. Packet capture helps to diagnose network anomalies both reactively and proactively. 
   Other uses include gathering network statistics, gaining information on network intrusions, 
   to debug client-server communications and much more.

Connection Monitor:
-) We need to inspect all the network traffic from VM1 to VM2 and not between the 2 VMs. 
   Even if we were using Connection monitor, this one would inspect only network traffic over a specific port. 
   And for a period of 3 hours, packet capture session time limit default value is 18000 seconds(5 hours).

IP Flow:
-) At some point, a VM may become unable to communicate with other resources, because of a security rule. 
   The IP flow verify capability enables you to specify a source and destination IPv4 address, port, protocol (TCP or UDP), 
   and traffic direction (inbound or outbound). IP flow verify then tests the communication and informs you if the 
   connection succeeds or fails. If the connection fails, IP flow verify tells you which.

Connection Troubleshoot:
-) Diagnose outbound connections from a VM: The connection troubleshoot capability enables you to test a connection between 
   a VM and another VM, an FQDN, a URI, or an IPv4 address. The test returns similar information returned when using the 
   connection monitor capability, but tests the connection at a point in time, rather than monitoring it over time, 
   as connection monitor does. Learn more about how to troubleshoot connections using connection-troubleshoot.


Data Collector Set (DCS):
-) 


Traffic Analytics:
-) Traffic Analytics is a cloud-based solution that provides visibility into user and application activity in cloud networks. 
  Traffic analytics analyzes Network Watcher network security group (NSG) flow logs to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Policy
-------
You assign an Azure policy that has the following settings:

⦿ Scope: Sub1

⦿ Exclusions: Sub1/RG1/VNET1                          <-- in this "Exclusions" field we can put any "Resource-name", then this policy will not
                                                                 apply on this "Resource"
⦿ Policy definition: Append a tag and its value to resources

⦿ Policy enforcement: Enabled

⦿ Tag name: Tag4

⦿ Tag value: value4


Policy Scope:
------------
we can apply a policy to "Management groups", "Subscriptions" , "Resource groups", "Resources"


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tags
----
You apply tags to your Azure resources giving metadata to logically organize them into a taxonomy. 
After you apply tags, you can retrieve all the resources in your subscription with that tag name and value. 
Each resource or resource group can have a maximum of 15 tag name/value pairs. Tags applied to the resource 
group are not inherited by the resources in that resource group.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Azure Log Analytics Workspace
----------------------------

Azure Activity Log:    <-- it helps to log the changes/modification in "Resources" at "Subscription-level"

----------------------------------------
Three ways to search for "error" logs in "Log Analytics Workspace" by "Kusto" language

1) Event | search "error"
2) Event | where EventType == "error"
3) search in (Event) "erro


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File-Share service
------------------

Imp:  File-Share uses NFS or SMB protocols 

Note: we use for connecting from on-premiss to Azure-File-Share with  "SMB" (Server Message Block)
      "SMB" require  TCP port 445 to be open between on-premiss and Azure-File-Share


e.g-1  (Question - 4.23)
-----

1) 
Storage account as "File-Share" in Azure
Name = share1

2)
On-premises Storage-account "File-Share"
Name = data1      Server=Server1    Path=D:\Folder1
Name = data2      Server=Server2    Path=D:\Folder2

3) we create an "Azure-File-Sync-Group" named "Sync1" and perform the following actions

Explanation: 
-) Here above we have created a "File-Sync-Group" = "Sync1"  in Azure. This "File-Sync-group" will defines the sync topology for a set of files.
-) after that we have created a Storage-account as "File Share" = "share1"  in Azure
-) after that we have added "share1" as "Cloud-Endpoint" for "Sync1"                         (Imp: we can have only one "Cloud-Endpoint" of "Azure File-Share")


-) after that we have Registered "Server1" and "Server2" to "Sync1"
-) after that we have added "data1" as a Server-Endpoint for "Sync1", as below we are registring the "Server1" to "Sync1" so it is ok
-) after that we have added "data2" as a Server-Endpoint for "Sync1", as below we are registring the "Server2" to "Sync1" so it is ok
                                                                                             (Imp: we can have many "Server-Endpoints")

Explanation
A sync group defines the sync topology for a set of files. Endpoints within a sync group are kept in sync with each other.
A sync group must contain one cloud endpoint, which represents an Azure file share and one or more server endpoints.
A server endpoint represents a path on a registered server. A server can have server endpoints in multiple sync groups. 
You can create as many sync groups as you need to appropriately describe your desired sync topology.




e.g-2  (5.15, 5.16, 5.17)
-----
1) 
Storage account as "File-Share" in Azure
Name = share1


2)
On-premises Storage-account "File-Share"
Server=Server1    Path=D:\Folder1, E:\Folder2                       (Imp: we are not alloweed to have tow "Endpoints" for one "Server", only one is alloweed)
Server=Server2    Path=D:\Data

3) we create an "Azure-File-Sync-Group" named "Group1". 
   Endpoints within a Sync-group are kept in sync with each other. 

-) after that we have Registered "Server1" and "Server2" to "Sync1"
-) after that we added D:\Folder1 on "Server1" as a server endpoint of "Group1"



Azure Resources
---------------
we create a  Storage Sync Service name:   Sync1
and an    Azure File Sync group name:     Group1

On-Premises 
----------
Server1 :  D:\Folder1
Server2 :  E:\Folder2


-) "Group1" useses "share1" as a cloud endpoint
-) we register "Server1" and "Server2" in "Sync1"
-) you add D:\Folder1 on "Server1" as a server endpoint of "Group1"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AKS Kubernetes
---------------

Cluster Autoscaler:  <-- it means "Nodes Autoscaler" so we use "az aks" commands
Pod Autoscaler:      <-- it means "Pod Autoscaler" so we use "kubectl" commands 

Cluster-Autoscaler:        <--  means that we are increasing the nodes in the cluster
Horizontal pod autoscaler: <--  means that we are increasing the number of pods


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Log
---

NSG logs
-------
NSG flow logs allow viewing information about ingress and egress IP traffic through a Network security group. 
Through this, the IP addresses that connect to the ILB can be monitored when the diagnostics are 
enabled on a Network Security Group.


IP flow verify
---------------
The IP flow verify capability enables you to specify a source and destination IPv4 address, port, protocol (TCP or UDP), 
and traffic direction (inbound or outbound). IP flow verify then tests the communication and informs you if the 
connection succeeds or fails. If the connection fails, IP flow verify tells you which security rule allowed or denied 
the communication, so that you can resolve the problem.


Connection Troubleshoot
-----------------------
The connection troubleshoot capability enables you to test a connection between a VM and another VM, an FQDN, a URI, 
or an IPv4 address. The test returns similar information returned when using the connection monitor capability, 
but tests the connection at a point in time, rather than monitoring it over time, as connection monitor does.



Internal Loadbalancer Logs
--------------------------
We cannot enable diagnostics on an internal load balancer to check for the IP addresses. As for Internal LB, 
it is basic one. Basic can only connect to storage account. Also, Basic LB has only activity logs, 
which doesn’t include the connectivity workflow. So, we need to use NSG to meet the mentioned requirements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IP ( Overlapping)
---

VNet1  10.11.0.0/16
VNet2  10.11.0.0/17
VNet3  10.10.0.0/22
VNet4  192.168.16.0/22

Check which other "VNet" can be peered with "VNet1"


VNet1 10.11.0.0/16      <-- it means     10.11.0.1 - 10.11.255.255   (overlap VNet2)

VNet2 10.11.0.0/17      <-- it means     10.11.0.1 - 10.11.127.254   (overlap VNet1)

VNet3 10.10.0.0/22      <-- it means      10.10.0.1 - 10.10.3.254    (no overlap)

VNet4 192.168.16.0/22   <-- it means  192.168.16.1 - 192.168.19.254  (no overlap)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DTU (Database Transaction units)
----
It is very simple to understand, it means how my read/write querys we can do on Database in per-sec
e.g:
In Azure SQL Database "Basic Plan" offer  1 till 4 IOPS per DTU, it means we can do max for read/write queries per DTU
In the "Basic Plan" Azure give us 5 DTUs , so it means if we create a Database under this plan then we can do 5x4=20
20 read/write operations per second.


Elastic pool:
---------------
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS_jqSzlK8c         <-- here it show a simple diagramm, with it is easy to understand the meaning of Elastic-pool


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Azure Site Recovery:
==================

Retention Point: ( Their are two types of retention points in Azure Site Recovery)
--------------
a) Crash-consistent recovery point:   <-- Site Recovery creates a crash-consistent recovery point every 5 minutes.
b) Application-consistent recovery point: <-- Site Recovery can create an application-consistent recovery point with a minimum frequency of 1 hour.
-----------------------------------
Elapsed time:       <-- it means the "time used" to do some work



Roles:
------
-) To Create or import a git repository, you must be a member of a "Project Administrators security group, 
   or have the Git project-level "Create repository" permission set to "Allow"


Azure Artifacts feeds:
----------------------
-) Feeds have four levels of access: Owners, Contributors, Collaborators, and Readers.


Release gates:
--------------
Release gates allow automatic collection of health signals from external services, and then promote the release 
when all the signals are successful at the same time or stop the deployment on timeout. Typically, 
gates are used in connection with incident management, problem management, change management, monitoring, and external approval systems.

Readiness & Liveness:
---------------------
Step-1)  Container is "Ready"      <-- this is checked by "Readiness"
Step-2)  Application is "Live"     <-- this is checked by "Liveness"


Smart Detection:
----------------
Smart Detection automatically warns you of potential performance problems, not security problems in your web application.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Users access-level
-----------------
Basic:             <-- this level provides access to most features
VS Enterprise:     <-- this level provides access to premium features
Stakeholders:      <-- this level provides partial access, can be assigned to unlimited users for free


Pilot Users:
-----------
those users whoare testing a application are called "Pilot Users"

Agent pool Workspace:


Azure Service Principal:
-----------------------
When you're using Azure Container Registry (ACR) with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), an authentication mechanism needs to be established.
You can set up AKS and ACR integration during the initial creation of your AKS cluster. To allow an AKS cluster to interact with ACR, 
an Azure Active Directory service principal is used.
Note: the simple explanation is, Their is a "Azure Container Registry" it has "Docker-image" saved in it, and now in the 
      "Azure Kubeneretes Service" we want to fetch these "docker-images" form the "ACR" in the "AKS", with the help of 
      "Azure Service Principal" we can make this connection that "AKS" can fetch the images frok "ACR"

Action Group:
-------------
An action group is a collection of notification preferences defined by the owner of an Azure subscription. Azure Monitor, 
Service Health and Azure Advisor alerts use action groups to notify users that an alert has been triggered.


Azure Resource Manager Template:
---------------------------------
their are two main "deployment-modes" in ARM 

1) Incremental-mode:   <-- it will just create or overwrite the resourses that are written in ARM Template, it does not effect other resources
2) Complete-mode:      <-- it create or overwrite the resources defined in the ART, if other resources available in the same "Resource-group"
                             then by using this "mode" it will delete all the other resources.
3) Validation:         <-- it validate only the ARM template 

-------------------------------------
Maven & Gradel   <---->  Java 
MS-Build         <---->  .Net 

--------------------------------------
Project:
-------
Scrum   <-- if we want to track  Product Backlog Items (PBIs) and bugs on the Kanban board.
Agile   <-- this already includes "Scrum" also and we can Track user stories and bugs on the Kanban board. 
                                                          Track user stories and bugs on the Task board.
CMMI     <--with this we can Track requirements, change requests, risks and reviews.                                                          

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extra points:
------------
-) "Azure web app"  and "Azure App"  both are same


-) Azure Front Door:       <-- with this we can create routing between  "Azure Web Apps" , it is a Global service, 
                                the apps can be in different regions
-) Azure Traffic Manager:  <-- This is a DNS-based traffic load balancer
                               with this we can create routing between "Public Endpoints" of any service, that service can be on
                               "Azure" or "On-Premiss", the services can in different regions
                               we can user it for routing traffic for "Azure Web Apps"
-) Azure Load balancer:    <-- with this we can load balancer the pool of instances, but all the services must be in same region.
                               it is like "Network load balancer" in AWS, it works with "Layer 4"

-) Azure Application Gateway:  <-- with this we can load balancer the service in same region, it works with "Layer 7" 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cost Management Budget:
-----------------------
Budgets are commonly used as part of cost control. Budgets can be scoped in Azure. For instance, you could narrow your budget 
view based on subscription, resource groups, or a collection of resources.

Note: we can apply "Budget rule" on subscription, resource groups, or a collection of resources.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Managed Identites ( for retriving secrets from "Azure Key Vault")
=================

Their are two types of "Managed Identites"

System-assigned Managed Identites:
---------------------------------
Some Azure services allow you to enable a managed identity directly on a service instance. When you enable a 
system-assigned managed identity an identity is created in Azure AD that is tied to the lifecycle of that service instance. 
So when the resource is deleted, Azure automatically deletes the identity for you. By design, only that Azure resource 
can use this identity to request tokens from Azure AD.

User-assigned Managed Identites:
-------------------------------
You may also create a managed identity as a standalone Azure resource. You can create a user-assigned managed identity 
and assign it to one or more instances of an Azure service. In the case of user-assigned managed identities, 
the identity is managed separately from the resources that use it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Network Watchers:
-----------------

Types of Network Watchers:

1) IP-flow

1.22
----
For each Region we have Single "Azure SQL DB Server" and "Elastic-pools", we can no say DB-Server in one region and the pool in 
another region, this is the region. for this question we need three "DB-Servers" and three "Elastic-pools"
